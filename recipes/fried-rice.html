    <p>This easy egg fried rice is a no-fuss weeknight meal that is better than takeout! Plus, it is made with only 8 key ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons peanut, vegetable, or olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onion, about 1 small onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups diced mixed vegetables, such as bell pepper, carrots, zucchini, etc.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced scallions, white and green parts divided</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked overnight jasmine rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
        <li>dash of ground white pepper, optional</li>
        <li>1 to 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h4> Pro. Tip:</h4>
    <p>Try to use day-old rice. This ensures that there isn't too much moisture in the rice so that the fried rice does not end up being too mushy. If you are cooking rice on the same day, let the rice cool completely before stir frying. </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol><li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them together.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet with 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the beaten eggs and scramble them for about a minute. Transfer the eggs to a dish and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil into a wok over high heat. Add the onions and cook them for about 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the mixed vegetables and white parts of the scallions and cook for 2 minutes. Season the vegetables with a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked rice into the pan or wok and cook for several minutes, until the rice is heated through. If there are large clumps of rice, break them apart with the back of your spatula.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce, five-spice powder, dash of white pepper (if using) and sesame oil and stir to distribute the seasonings. (See note 6) Add the scrambled eggs and stir to mix again. Garnish with remaining sliced scallions. Serve immediately.</li>
